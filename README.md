**STEP TO EXECUTE THE QUERY**
1. Please copy query from the file named **Jobs_View.sql**. This will create a view table based on the query given in the assessment.
2. Please copy and run the query from the file named **Jobs_Fulltext_Index.sql** in your SQL Query Execution area. This will create a FullText Index for the column to be searched by the query.
3. Lastly, please copy and run the query from the file name **Searching Query.php** in your SQL Query Execution area to run the query.

**--NOTE--**
1. I may not be able to execute the query since there are no sample data to be imported in my database. I hope this method helps the query to improve its performance.

**TIME TAKEN FOR THIS TEST**
- 3 Hours including research and rewriting the SQL Query.
